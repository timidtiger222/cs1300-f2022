  <h1>Uniqlo Self-Checkout Kiosk</h1>
  <h5>PROJECT PROMPT</h5>
  <p>Step into a user's shoes. Individually, you will observe real users interacting with an interface,
    interview these individuals about their experiences, create personas based on these users, and
    illustrate a storyboard for one of your personas.</p>

      <h2>Part 1 : Interface</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      <h5>INTERFACE SKETCH & DESCRIPTION</h5>
      <p>For this assignment, I chose to study the self-checkout kiosk at Uniqlo, a Japanese casual wear clothing store.
         The kiosk is composed of a bin to place clothing items, a checkout tablet, a card reader, and a receipt printer. 
         Customers 1) place all clothing items into the bin (which automatically scans
         them using RFID technology), 2) press "Start" on the tablet, 3) confirm the number of items is correct, 4) select payment and obtain receipt, and 5) bag items. 
         This interface solves the issue of users having to scan each individual item, creating a streamlined and enjoyable experience.

      <h2>Part 2 : Research</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      <h5>OBSERVATIONS</h5>
      <p>First, I objectively observed how users interacted with the kiosk. I was also able to
        record a friend using the interface to capture each screen on the tablet. I recorded the following
        observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users often had intrigued, impressed, or excited expressions to the automatic scanning.</li>
        <li>Users typically spent around 3-5 minutes to complete the entire checkout process.</li>
        <li>Very few customers required staff to help figure out the kiosk.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS</h5>
      <p>I then conducted interviews with 3 different users to gain a deeper understanding of
        their motives, experiences, and expectations when using the kiosk. From the 5 questions asked,
        I aggregated the most common responses.

      <h2>Part 3 : Personas</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      <h5>PERSONAS</h5>
      <p>Based on observations and user interviews, I created two personas that represent achetypes of people who typically use this kiosk. 
        These personas are represented through a "Thinks, Feels, Says, Does" empathy map.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: Storyboard</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      <h5>STORYBOARD</h5>
      <p>Using the "Efficient Eddie" persona, I created a storyboard mapping out his user journey from start to end.</p>
